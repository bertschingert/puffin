program			= {routine}

routine 		= begin_routine
			| end_routine
			| routine

begin_routine		= "begin", action

end_routine		= "end", action

routine			= [condition], [action]

condition		= expression

action			= "{", [statement_list], "}"

statement_list 		= [statement], [{";", [statement]}]

statement		= print_statement
			| assignment_statement

print_statement		= "print", expression

assignment_statement	= identifier, "=", expression

expression		= identifier
			| number
			| expression, binop, expression

identifier		= scalar_identifier
			| array_identifier

array_identifier	= scalar_identifier, "[", expression, "]"

scalar_identifier	= what it sounds like

number			= what it sounds like (positive integers only, so far)

binop			= "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
